# Tableau
Tableau dashboard of PhD students' Career Outcomes
Welcome any comments and feedback on my current #Tableau Project on the #utaustin UT Austin Ph.D. Studentsâ€™ Career Outcomes #dashboard. This project helps Graduate job seekers position themselves by demonstrating the locations, industries, companies, and job titles UT previous Ph.D. students are pursuing right now. Students can find their possible #career trajectories by checking their college, department, and specialization or simply typing in their ideal job title keywords to explore their career possibilities.
